# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 19, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Downloaded neccessary guides and tools to complete my 100 Days of Code. Completed HankerRank

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with creating an psuedocode algorithm for the the challenege today, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. I managed to figuring out some basic python fundamentals that helped to solve problem via Google searches.

### Day 0: November 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I have taken the initiative in the last two weeks to learn python and I'm using 'Learn how to Code' by Eric Freeman as my an introductory guide. Today, I decided to review Chp 2-4 since I took a little break during vacation.

**Thoughts**: Everyday is a learning process. Some days are more difficult than others yet, I will strive to stay motivated.
